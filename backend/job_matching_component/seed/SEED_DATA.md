## Features Tested

The seed data allows you to test:

1. **Job Search & Filtering** - Filter jobs by skills, location, type
2. **Opportunity Center** - Score analysis and recommendations
3. **Saved Jobs** - Bookmark management
4. **Notifications** - Real-time alerts and reminders
5. **Profile Matching** - Skills vs job requirements
6. **Deadline Tracking** - Urgency classification
7. **Success Predictions** - Interview and offer chance estimates

## Resetting Data

The seed file uses upsert operations and deleteMany to clear demo data before creating new records. Running the seed again will:
1. Clear previous demo student/employer accounts
2. Clear previous demo jobs
3. Clear previous saved jobs and notifications
4. Create fresh test data

This ensures clean data state without data duplicates.

## Data Structure

All seeded data follows the MongoDB schema structures defined in:
- `backend/models/User.js` - User schema
- `backend/job_matching_component/models/Job.js` - Job schema
- `backend/job_matching_component/models/Notification.js` - Notification schema
- `backend/job_matching_component/models/SavedJob.js` - SavedJob schema
- `backend/job_matching_component/models/OpportunityScore.js` - OpportunityScore schema

## Performance

Typical seed execution time: **2-3 seconds**
- Database connection: ~1 second
- User creation: ~0.5 seconds
- Jobs creation: ~0.5 seconds
- Related data seeding: ~0.5-1 second

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
Ensure MongoDB connection string is set in `.env`:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname
```

### Schema Validation Errors
If you see validation errors, ensure all models are properly updated with the latest schema definitions.

### Duplicate Key Errors
If the seed fails with duplicate key errors, manually delete all demo users and try again:
```js
// In MongoDB shell
db.users.deleteMany({ email: { $in: ['student1@careersync.test', ...] } })
```

## Notes

- ✅ All credentials use the same password pattern for easy testing
- ✅ Dates are dynamically calculated (jobs expire in 7-15 days)
- ✅ Opportunity scores are randomized for realistic variation
- ✅ Error handling is built in - partial failures won't stop the seed
- ✅ Idempotent design - safe to run multiple times
